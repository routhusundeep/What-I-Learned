Various things I have learned. My primary interests are datastores and distributed systems.

A disclaimer, most of the content in the notes is plagiarized from the papers. None of this is not meant to be an original piece of work.

The process I generally follow is:
* First read - just read and understand the paper
* Second read - copy excepts and take notes
* Third read - write my own opinion concisely, admittedly, I am behind on this :see_no_evil:
