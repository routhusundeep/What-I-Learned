- First Pass
  - read title, abstract and introduction
  - read section and sub-section headings, ignore everything else
  - read the conclusions

  - At the end of first pass you should be able to answer
    - Category - The type of paper
    - Context - related papers, area
    - Correctness - Do the assumptions appear valid
    - Contributions - main contributions
    - Clarity - is the paper well written
- Second Pass
  - Look carefully at the diagrams, graphs and other illustrations in the paper
  - Remember to mark relevant unread references for further reading
  - You should be grasp the content of the paper after this step
- Third Pass
