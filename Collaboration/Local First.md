The cloud gives us collaboration, but old-fashioned apps give us ownership. Can’t we have the best of both worlds? We would like both the convenient cross-device access and real-time collaboration provided by cloud apps, and also the personal ownership of your own data embodied by “old-fashioned” software

#### Seven Ideals for Local-first Software
1. **No Spinners: Your Work at Your Fingertips**
	With cloud apps, since the primary copy of the data is on a server, all data modifications, and many data lookups, require a round-trip to a server.
	Local-first software is different: because it keeps the primary copy of the data on the local device, there is never a need for the user to wait for a request to a server to complete.
2. **Your Work Is Not Trapped on One Device**
3. **The Network Is Optional**
4. **Seamless Collaboration with Your Colleagues**
	Collaboration typically requires that several people contribute material to a document or file. However, in old-fashioned software it is problematic for several people to work on the same file at the same time: the result is often a conflict.
	In local-first apps, our ideal is to support real-time collaboration that is on par with the best cloud apps today, or better.
5. **The Long Now**
	Local-first software enables greater longevity because your data, and the software that is needed to read and modify your data, are all stored locally on your computer.
6. **Security and Privacy by Default**
7. **You Retain Ultimate Ownership and Control**
