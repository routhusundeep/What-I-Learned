A approach of designing web application with a no-code/low-code/drag-and-drop-from-out-catalog style of design.
Like Adrian, I too am not a fan of such CASE(Computer aided software engineering) tools.
Most of the time, the problems mentioned will have clean solution because the chosen abstraction will be very well suited to them, I would like to analyze an example where this proposed concepts does not suite the design, will it be worth going along with the cumbersome workarounds for those problems?

** will read about stream and batch processing in the future
flink, spark, tez and their internal details
